# Machine-Learning-Classifier-Evaluation-of-AudioMNIST-Data-Set
First clone the following git repository: https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST

Next execute the 'preprocess_data.py' script from the AudioMNIST repo, then a folder named 'preprocessed_data' should be created, 
the path to this folder will be referenced as 'PREPROCESSED_DATA_FOLDER' from now on.

Now change your directory to this repo and execute 'python merge_data.py --source PREPROCESSED_DATA_FOLDER' and a 'merged' folder should appear.

If everything worked you can now try all the experiments yourself and even try out new classifiers with the data.
